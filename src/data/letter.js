  title: "A Love Letter to Jaenelle",
  content: ` My dearest Jaenelle,
  
  Every moment I spend with you feels like a beautiful dream that I never want to wake up from. Your presence brings me a sense of peace and joy that words can hardly express. It's the way you laugh, the way you smile, and the way your eyes light up when you talk about the things you love (food, yeah). I feel so incredibly lucky to have you in my life.
  
  When I was with you, time seemed to pass so fast. The hours we spend together felt like mere minutes, yet those moments are etched in my heart forever. I treasure every shared conversation, every joke, every hug, every kiss and every quiet moment where we just exist together. You have a way of making the world feel like a better place simply by being in it.
  
  Your kindness, compassion, and understanding make me a better person every day. You make me believe in the goodness of people and remind me to always look for the silver lining. You are a constant source of support, encouragement, and inspiration. I find myself constantly amazed by your strength, your love, and the way you navigate through life with grace and beauty.
  
  I cherish the way we can talk about anything, from the deep and meaningful to the silliest conversation. With you, I feel understood and valued, as if I am exactly where I’m meant to be. Our connection is something I never knew I needed, but now that I have it, I can’t imagine my life without you.
  
  You are my heart's home. You are the person I turn to when I need comfort, the one I celebrate with in moments of joy, and the one I lean on through life’s challenges. You make everything feel brighter, and you fill my days with happiness that I never thought possible.
  
  I want to spend the rest of my life building memories with you, creating a future filled with love, laughter, and endless adventures. I promise to stand by your side, to support you, and to love you with all that I am. There is nothing I wouldn’t do for you, Jaenelle, because you are my everything.
  
  That's the end of this letter and the surprise, but hey, we still have a long way to go, a long life ahead of us. I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you. This is the end of this surprise and it marks the beginning of a new year in our lives. Keep growing, keep smiling. Also if you're crying, please wipe your tears :). Love you <3

  Forever yours,
  Nithin`,
