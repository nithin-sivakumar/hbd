    "Finally, it's your birthday. I still remember how it felt when I spoke to you for the first time. I really can't wrap my head around how fast time flew. It almost feels like I've met you just yesterday, and on the other hand, it also feels like I've known you for longer than I've lived. I haven't loved anyone the way I love you. What I feel for you, it's new, it's bright and it feels right. I'll keep this for another day, but for now, let's celebrate your birthday, (a bit late, but) shall we? Click the button below whenever you're ready. Love you boich.",
