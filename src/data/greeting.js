    "I was afraid you wouldn't come here. It's been so long since your birthday has started. Nithin told me you like flowers, so I thought I'd get you some. Here are your favourite Orchids, Tulips and some Roses, your highness! It's gonna take a while, there's a lot of people eager to meet you. Good luck on that journey. I know you'll love it. (Keep this between us... this website actually looked white. And it was beautiful, but your boyfriend fought with us all and changed it to black just because you liked black. Some crazy-in-love guy you've got there 😁)",
